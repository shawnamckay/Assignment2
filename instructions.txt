-----------------------------------------
- Tested on Chrome and Opera


Set up and Compilation
======================
- Copy and paste all files in the chai 3d library in the templates folder
- Open the application.xcodeproj in Xcode
- Press Command + R to compile and run the application



Usage
=====
- The program will default open on shape 1, the sphere
- To switch from the sphere, heart, whiffle cube and torus press buttons 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively
- To turn on light friction press the left button on the haptic device, to turn on heavier friction press the right button and to turn off friction press the centre button. 
- To quit the program, press escape.



Gotcha's
========
- Limit cycle is only addressed in the frictionless case and I would consider the limit cycling reduced but not fixed completely.
